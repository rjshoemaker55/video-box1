My Concierge is an elegant virtual travel assistant. It provides a simplistic, minimalist approach to searching for hotels and flights.

## Work in Progress
Due to API issues, the flight and hotel searches are not fully functional. We have included some placeholder flights for the time being, but this feature will be completed shortly.

### What's to come
Besides the flight and hotel search functionality, we will also be adding:

 1. [ ] Validation for form inputs
 2. [ ] Back and forward navigation for form
 3. [ ] User accounts for saving searches
 
 Will add other options as they come to mind.
